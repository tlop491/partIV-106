# Peer-to-Peer Transactive Energy Model for New Zealand Electricity Consumers

In the Smart Grid environment, increasingly homes and businesses are investing in solar PV, high-energy battery storage systems and EV's.   There is a need to develop mechanisms, tools and framework to purchase electricity not only from the energy retailers but also to trade peer-to-peer amongst consumers. Transactive energy is the emerging area of Power systems economics that has started appearing in research literature and being trialled in the US (Brooklyn Microgrid),  New Zealand, Australia and other countries which  have functional electricity market operations. 

Block chain  architecture, using Ethereum hard-fork implementation of Smart Contract,  was a pathway that  was conceptualized, developed and trialled using transactive energy framework, through a 2017 Part IV power system project.  The proof-of-concept was demonstrated, using the two UoA 3-kW grid connected solar system, battery storage, smart meter, PLC, micro-grid simulator, New Zealand wholesale real-time electricity market display etc. available at the Power systems Lab and interacting with UoA property services for grid services.

The aim of 2018 project is to come up with a peer-to-peer trading platform based on the 2017 project learnings but extending it to technical and pricing developments in power system economics for a case-study of co-located or neighbourhood residential community that have invested in smart grid technologies like solar PV, battery storage and electric vehicles.  The concept of time-value (as per the following publication) is one option that can be explored along with others that the project student group comes up with.

Data from communities in New Zealand that have invested in solar/battery and EV trials are available to the Power system research group through ongoing and past research projects can be used by the this project.

## Getting Started
This repository will serve as a way to collabrate between all members of the group as well as the supervisors. The repository contains papers, minutes and other administrative files. Project implementation code will eventually be added and become the main use of this. Research Papers will be those which are most useful and shareable within copyright. There will also be a summary of useful papers.
